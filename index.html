            <p>“I never felt insecure before I got into this space,” Ms. Graber said. “But I just realized there is no one else like me.
            It is a very hard feeling when you don’t see anyone who is like you.” Ms. Graber said she had considered leaving the industry.
            “I have this perpetual sense of being on the outside of that conversation,” she said. “It’s just a general state of alienation.”</p>
            <p>When we gather together as a community and start having these conversations, it makes it easier for other people to come in too.</p>

              <p>We are still at a really early stage and the possibilites are largely unwritten. But there are ideas being discussed in a lot of different fields. We're going to look back at how it got started and along the way begin to understand what it is.</p>

              <p> IT and business research and advisory firm Gartner charts emerging technologies and assesses where they are in terms of
              usefuless and viability for business purposes. They do a yearly report of things business leaders should watch, and they
              chart technologies to identify a sort of lifecycle.</p>
              <p>We're leaving the Peak of Inflated Expectations: Early publicity produces a number of success stories — often accompanied by scores of failures.
              Some companies take action; many do not. </p>
              <p>Entering into the Trough of Disillusionment: Interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail
              to deliver. Producers of the technology shake out or fail. Investments continue only if the surviving providers improve their
              products to the satisfaction of early adopters.</p>
              <p>So we're at this interesting point in the cycle where the craziness is dying down and things are beginning to settle. It's a good time for measured, thoughtful conversations.</p>

              <p>Blocks in the chain begin to be used for more than a transaction record -- beyond just an exchange.</p>
